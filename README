-----------
What is it?
-----------

    numint is a new numerical integrator to *NIX's users. It works to estimate
functions they are so hard to find a primitive. Maybe this task is so hard, then
we use threads to accelerate it.

--------------
How compiling?
--------------

    The best way to compile is to use "make". You also will need a compiler, we
recommend "gcc" or "g++", and the easier to compile "make".
    Ensure they are installed and so run:

    $ make

    It will generate a executable program called "numint". Sucess!!!

Command Line Arguments
----------------------

Example: $ ./numint --function "e^(x^(2))" --from 0 --to 100 --error 1000
            --thread MAX

  This command will return a numerical approximation of a given function with
limits of integration, and maximum error. The processing  will be working with
maximum of CPU's cores. A brief explain of arguments is below:

    -f, --function  Function that will be evaluated.
        Required.

    -a, --from      Integration start interval
        Required.

    -b, --to        Integration end interval.
        Required.

    -e, --error     Maximum error to estimate the integrate.
        Required.

    -t, --thread    Numbers of threads to concurrent approach.
        Optional.

    -v, --verbose   Show messages while the application runs.
        Optional.
